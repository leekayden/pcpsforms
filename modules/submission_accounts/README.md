## Submission Accounts module

The Submission Accounts module lets you convert your form submissions into basic user accounts, allowing the people who originally submitted the form to log in and update their submission at a later date. This module can be used for as many forms as you want, and provides a fair amount of control over what information can be viewed and edited by the user.
