## module_client-audit

The Client Audit module provides Form Tools administrators with a way to track key events / actions that occur
on client accounts, such as when the clients accounts are logging in and out, when they are updated and what
permission changes occur and at what time. This, coupled with a very simple but powerful search tool, provides
an invaluable tool for security and auditing purposes.
